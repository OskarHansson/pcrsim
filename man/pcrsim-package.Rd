  Forensic DNA process simulator.
}
\details{
  PCRsim is a package for simulating the forensic DNA
  process. \code{pcrsim} opens up a graphical user
  interface which allow the user to enter parameters
  required for the simulation. Once calibrated the program
  can be used to: reduce the laboratory work needed for
  validation of new STR kits, help develop methods for
  interpretaion of DNA evidence, etc. This is a first
  version which is still experimental/under development.
