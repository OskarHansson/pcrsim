Description: pcrsim is a package for simulating the forensic DNA process. pcrsim()
 opens up a graphical user interface which allow the user to enter parameters
 required for the simulation. Once calibrated the program can be used to:
 reduce the laboratory work needed for validation of new STR kits,
 help develop methods for interpretation of DNA evidence, etc.
 This is an early version which is still experimental and under development.
