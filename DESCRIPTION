Description: Simulate the forensic DNA process: generate random or fixed DNA
    profiles, create forensic samples including mixtures of diploid and haploid
    cells, simulate DNA extraction, normalization, degradation, amplification
    including stutters and inter-locus balance, and capillary electrophoresis.
    DNA profiles are visualized as electropherograms and saved in tables.
    The command pcrsim() opens up a graphical user interface which allow the user
    to create projects, to enter, load, and save parameters required for the simulation.
    The simulation is transparent and the parameters used in each step of the simulation
    can be viewed in the result tables.
